>**Disclaimer:** Because Cloudflare effectively rebuilds the site from scratch each time I update a page, you may notice some irregularities if you're looking at the site at the same time that an update is being pushed. This interruption should be brief, and otherwise have no impact on your use of the site.

# Maintenance History

#### 12/2/2023 - 2 PM PT to 4 PM PT
What: **Possible Maintenance Outage**
When: 12/2/2023 - 2 PM PT to 4 PM PT
Why: Digital Garden version update and security maintenance
Notes: I've been sitting on a pending update, and after some experimenting with the security headers (which had to the outage last), I've got a safest-config I want to implement.

Hopefully there shouldn't actually be an outage, but I can't guarantee that. There may be intermittent outages or features that stop working.

#### 11/14 - 11/15 2023
1. Got a bug to try to fix the site headers to improve site security.
