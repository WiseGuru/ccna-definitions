### Planned Maintenance
None.

>**Disclaimer:** Because Cloudflare effectively rebuilds the site from scratch each time I update a page, you may notice some irregularities if you're looking at the site at the same time that an update is being pushed. This interruption should be brief, and otherwise have no impact on your use of the site.

# Maintenance History

#### 11/25/2024 - 9:00 AM PT to 9:45 AM PT
What: **Re-arrange folders and add coloration to sidebar graph**
When: 11/25/2024 - 9:00 AM PT to 9:45 AM PT
Why: Improve navigation and site accessibility.
Notes: I recently discovered how to add coloration to the nodes in the sidebar graph, and so I wanted to implement them for this site and for improved utility. Also, changing how the folders are arranged make it easier to do, and I think makes the site a little more user-friendly. Of course, I used the wrong kind of deployment, so the change is going to take much longer than anticipated and might fail because of queue count. Will cross that bridge when I get there.


#### 1/18/2024 - 3 PM PT to 3:20 PM PT
What: **Possible Maintenance Outage**
When: 1/18/2024 - 3 PM PT to 3:20 PM PT
Why: Digital Garden version update and security maintenance
Notes: Upgrade from whatever Digital Garden version I'm currently on, 1.59.0, to 1.60.0.

#### 12/2/2023 - 2 PM PT to 4 PM PT
What: **Possible Maintenance Outage**
When: 12/2/2023 - 2 PM PT to 4 PM PT
Why: Digital Garden version update and security maintenance
Notes: I've been sitting on a pending update, and after some experimenting with the security headers (which had to the outage last), I've got a safest-config I want to implement.

Hopefully there shouldn't actually be an outage, but I can't guarantee that. There may be intermittent outages or features that stop working.

#### 11/14 - 11/15 2023
1. Got a bug to try to fix the site headers to improve site security.
