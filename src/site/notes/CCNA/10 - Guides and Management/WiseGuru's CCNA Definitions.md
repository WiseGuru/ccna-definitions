Welcome to WiseGuru's community-driven site of **CCNA Definitions**! The goal of this is a living document is to provide you with concise, relevant definitions for any topic you might encounter on the *CCNA*. This is not a replacement for an instructor-led course or the OCG, but should help you to fill in any gaps.

This is (and always will be) a **work in progress**, and as such, it will have *incomplete* or *incorrect* information. I started this database of definitions in 2023, part-way through my own CCNA studies, and so some entries were never updated beyond creation or were created at all.

### Contributing

You can help! If you find any information that is incorrect or incomplete (*within the scope of the CCNA*), PLEASE submit a ticket on GitHub with a *correction* and *source*. I will update the page and add a link to your profile on the page as a contributor.

There are two ways you can submit information; either through this [Google Forms Survey](https://forms.gle/HmYY8zjdgzJQFiWr5), or by submitting an **issue on GitHub.**
Please note that any information submitted via the **Google Form** is *inferior*, ONE-WAY communication; I will not be able to follow up with you to answer questions, seek clarification, or update you on the status of the request.

When submitting new information, I would appreciate it if followed this [[CCNA/10 - Guides and Management/Style Guide\|Style Guide/Template]], but it's not necessary. Thank you!

**Additionally**, if you're familiar with *GitHub* and *Obsidian* markdown editor, I am trying to streamline a process for users to access these definitions within their own vault. If you have ideas on how this might be accomplished, please reach out to me!

#### Plagiarism
I used [Jeremy's IT Lab Free CCNA Complete Course 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ) and Neil Anderson's [Complete CCNA Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete/) as my primary sources while studying, and used [Boson ExSim to practice for the exam](https://exams.boson.com/exams) and while I have gone back and tried to remove any duplicated information from their courses, I am sure I have missed some. Please report any plagiarized information to me, and I will replace it with original content.
