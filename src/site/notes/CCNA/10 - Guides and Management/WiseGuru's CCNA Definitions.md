>I've just added a [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/25 - Mnemonics and Summaries/Subnetting Walk-through\|Subnetting Walk-through]]; if you're uncomfortable with **Subnetting**, give it a look! I'd love to hear any feedback.

### Planned Maintenance

#### 12/2/2023 - 2 PM PT to 4 PM PT
What: **Possible Maintenance Outage**
When: 12/2/2023 - 2 PM PT to 4 PM PT
Why: Digital Garden version update and security maintenance
Notes: I've been sitting on a pending update, and after some experimenting with the security headers (which had to the outage last), I've got a safest-config I want to implement.

Hopefully there shouldn't actually be an outage, but I can't guarantee that. There may be intermittent outages or features that stop working.

## Updated Pages
Curious what's been updated since you were last here? Check out the [CCNA Definitions vault commits page on GitHub!](https://github.com/WiseGuru/ccna-definitions-vault/commits/main) Click on a commit to see which pages were changed and the exact changes that occurred.

# CCNA Definitions

Welcome to WiseGuru's *community-driven* site of **CCNA Definitions**! The goal of this is a living document is to provide you with *concise*, *relevant definitions* for any topic you might encounter on the **CCNA**. This is not a replacement for an *instructor-led course* or the [Cisco OCG](https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccna-200-301-official-cert-guide-library-9781587147142), but should help reinforce what you've learned.

This is (and always will be) a **work in progress**, and as such, it will have *incomplete* or *incorrect* information. I started this database of definitions in 2023 part-way through my own CCNA studies, and so some entries were never updated beyond creation or were never created at all.

If you're not sure where to start, I'm trying to get everything sorted by their [[CCNA/10 - Guides and Management/CCNA Objectives and Exam Topics\|CCNA Objectives and Exam Topics]]. I'm going through every page to connect all the exam topics, but let me know if I've missed one (and please include its topic!)

### Add these notes directly to your Obsidian Vault
If you would like a copy of these notes **directly** in your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) **vault**, now you can! Just go to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/WiseGuru/ccna-definitions-vault), click on the "Code" dropdown menu, and download it as a *zip* file. Extract the folders and copy/paste them into your vault, and you should be good to go!

If you have any problems, let me know either through this [Google Forms Survey](https://forms.gle/HmYY8zjdgzJQFiWr5), or by submitting an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WiseGuru/ccna-definitions-vault/issues/new).

You can also [[CCNA/10 - Guides and Management/How to fork this repository\|fork this repository]] and use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to synchronize changes. I hope to be posting instructions soon on how to do this.

# Help me make this better

You can help! If you find any information that is incorrect or incomplete (*within the scope of the CCNA*), PLEASE submit a ticket on **GitHub** with a *correction* and *source*. I will update the page and add a link to your profile (either GitHub or another service you specify) on the page as a contributor.

[[CCNA/10 - Guides and Management/Problematic pages\|Problematic pages]] has an ongoing list of pages that need review; if you have any suggestions on making them better, let me know!

There are *two ways* you can submit information; either through this [Google Forms Survey](https://forms.gle/HmYY8zjdgzJQFiWr5), or by submitting an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WiseGuru/ccna-definitions-vault/issues/new).
- Please note that any information submitted via the **Google Form** is *anonymous*, ONE-WAY communication; **I will not be able to follow up with you** to answer questions, seek clarification, or update you on the status of the request.

When submitting new information, I would appreciate it if followed this [[CCNA/10 - Guides and Management/Style Guide\|Style Guide/Template]], but it's not necessary. Thank you!
### Project Goals
If you're familiar with *GitHub* and *Obsidian* markdown editor, I am trying to streamline a process for other students to access these definitions within their own vault. If you have ideas on how this might be accomplished, please reach out to me!


## Unoriginal Content
During my studies, I used [Jeremy's IT Lab Free CCNA Complete Course 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ) and Neil Anderson's [Complete CCNA Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete/) as my primary sources, and used [Boson ExSim to practice for the exam](https://exams.boson.com/exams). While I have gone through and tried to remove any duplicated information from their courses, I am sure I have missed some. Please report any unoriginal information to me, and I will replace it with original content.
