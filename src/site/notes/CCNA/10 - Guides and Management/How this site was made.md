Wanna know how I made this site? Well, that information is *way beyond the scope* of this project^[And all the pictures were causing delays with site updates], so I've moved it to my "*main technical blog*"^[Sure, if you had more than two posts there], [Maxwell Hackswell](https://www.maxwellhackswell.com). It's where I document *static* technical problems and documents. For a more *dynamic* experience,^[And where you'll find other information about Digital Gardens] check out my mind-dump-hole, [Wisdump.work](https://wisdump.work).
