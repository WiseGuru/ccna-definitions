#### PSK
- A *Pre-Shared Key* is a cryptographic key (i.e. password) used in [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/WPA Authentication Modes\|Wireless]] and [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/VPN\|VPN]] authentication.
	- "Pre-shared" means that the key is shared between parties before communication begins
	- *PSKs* are usually human readable, and the strength of the *PSK* is highly dependent on its length and complexity
