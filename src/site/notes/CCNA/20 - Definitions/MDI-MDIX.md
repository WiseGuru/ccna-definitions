#### MDI/MDIX
- *Medium-dependent interface (MDI)* and *medium dependent interface crossover (MDI-X)* describe which wire pairs in a [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Copper\|Copper]] cable are used to transmit and receive data on a specific interface
	- Depending on how the neighboring interface is marked (MDI or MDIX), an admin would need to use a [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Copper\|straight through]] or [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Copper\|crossover]] cable.

##### Auto-MDIX
- *Auto-MDIX* interfaces automatically discover whether they need to perform as MDI or MDIX interfaces, and will switch as needed
