Definition: 
- Hubs are [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 1\|Layer 1]] multi-port repeaters that forward signals to all active ports. Used for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment.
- Hubs operate in [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Half-Duplex\|Half-Duplex]] mode and **share the same [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Collision Domain\|Collision Domain]]
- Not [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/MAC Address\|MAC]] address aware; whenever a [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/802.3 Frames\|Frame]] is received, it is flooded out all ports apart from the one it was received on
- Hosts connected through a hub use [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/CSMA-CD\|CSMA/CD]] to detect collisions and resend frames
