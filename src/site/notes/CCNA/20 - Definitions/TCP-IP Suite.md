		1. Contains the [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 5\|Session]], [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 6\|Presentation]], and [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 7\|Application]] layers from OSI
	2. **Layer 3: Transport
		1. Equivalent to the [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 4\|Transport Layer]] layer from OSI
	3. **Layer 2: Internet
		1. Equivalent to the [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 3\|Network]] layer in OSI
	4. **Layer 1**: Network Access
