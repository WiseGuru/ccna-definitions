#### Broadcast Domain
- A *broadcast domain* is any network where messages sent to the [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Broadcast Address\|Broadcast Address]] will be distributed to all connected [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Node\|nodes]]
	- All devices connected to a simple [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Switch\|switch]] are on the same *broadcast domain*
	- [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Router\|Routers]] separate *broadcast domains*, and can be used to route traffic between them.
