#### Duplex Mismatch
- A *Duplex Mismatch* occurs when the interfaces on a [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Link\|Link]] are not both [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Half-Duplex\|Half-Duplex]] or both [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Full-Duplex\|Full-Duplex]]
	- A *Duplex Mismatch* results in [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Collisions\|Collisions]] as traffic is sent over the same wire, resulting in corrupted data


#### Speed Mismatch
- A *Speed Mismatch* occurs when the *transmission [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Speed\|Speed]]* of two interfaces on a link does not match
