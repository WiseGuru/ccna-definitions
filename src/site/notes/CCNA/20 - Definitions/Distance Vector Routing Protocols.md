#### Distance Vector routing protocols
- Routers using *DV routing protocols* send its directly connected neighbors a list of all its known networks along with its own distance to each of those networks
	- Do not advertise the entire topology
	- often called "Routing by Rumor"
	- The two main protocols are [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/RIP\|RIP]] and [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/EIGRP\|EIGRP]]
