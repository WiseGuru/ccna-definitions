#### CSMA/CS
*Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD)* is used for detecting and recovering from [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Collision Domain\|collisions]]. It is a Medium Access Control ([[CCNA/20 - Definitions/MAC Address\|MAC]]) sublayer method that uses carrier-sensing to defer transmissions until no other stations are transmitting.
