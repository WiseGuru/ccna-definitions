#### Access
- The interface will only serve one *Data* VLAN and one *Voice* VLAN
- Typically, traffic on access ports is *untagged* because there's only one VLAN, and hosts usually don't know what to do with that traffic
	- Traffic to and from the *Data* VLAN (e.g., a PC) is *untagged*
	- Traffic to and from the *Voice* VLAN (i.e., a VoIP phone) is *tagged*
- [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/DTP\|DTP]] is disabled on the device
- If connected to a *trunk* port, it will not form a link
