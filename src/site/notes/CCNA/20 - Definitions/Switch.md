#### Switch
- *Switches* are most commonly [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 2\|Layer 2]] devices used to build a network connection between the attached devices.
- It understands [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/MAC Address\|MAC]] addressing, and sends data packets only to its destination port, limiting the number of collisions.
- [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 3\|Layer 3]] switches exist, which can perform some of the duties of a router
