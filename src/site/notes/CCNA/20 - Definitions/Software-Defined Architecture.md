- **Software-Defined Architecture (SDA)** is an overarching concept that encompasses things like [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/SDN\|SDN]], [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/SD-WAN\|SD-WAN]], etc.
	- [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/SD-WAN\|SD-WAN]] is Cisco's solution for automating WANs
	- [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/SD-Access\|SD-Access]] is Cisco's solution for automating LANs
