#### Containers
- *Containers* are isolated environments that contain all of the required dependencies for the contained app, hosted on a *Container Orchestrator*
	- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) are popular Container orchestrators
- Instead of running multiple [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/VMs\|VMs]], each with their own underlying hardware requirements, *Containers* allow for more rapid scaling and deployment of web apps
