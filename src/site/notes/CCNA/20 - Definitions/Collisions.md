#### Collisions
- *Collisions* occur when two or more devices attempt to send a packet simultaneously over the same [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Collision Domain\|Collision Domain]] (e.g., a [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Hub\|Hub]], [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Half-Duplex\|Half-Duplex]] link, etc.)
- Collisions can be avoided on [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Half-Duplex\|Half-Duplex]] connections by using [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/CSMA-CD\|CSMA/CD]] (on wired networks) or [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/CSMA-CA\|CSMA/CA]] (on wireless networks)
- Additionally, [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Full-Duplex\|Full-Duplex]] links are able to send and receive data simultaneously, preventing collisions
