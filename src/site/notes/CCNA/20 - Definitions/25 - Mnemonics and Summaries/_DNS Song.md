### DNS Song
To itsy bitsy spider
- `ip domain-lookup` let's you lookup domains
- And `ip name-server` says who is serving names
- But if the router's serving, `ip dns server`
- And `ip host` lets you serve the domains
- (melodically repeat previous line)
- But to name the network, use `ip domain-name`
