#### ASIC
- *Application-Specific Integrated Circuit* (Network Automation, review)
- Used in [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/SDN\|SDN Data Plane]] operations instead of CPUs, as they are faster and more robust
	- When a [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/802.3 Frames\|frame]] is received, the ASIC is responsible for switching logic
- The MAC address table/[[CCNA/20 - Definitions/CAM Table\|CAM Table]] is stored on a special kind of memory called a **TCAM (Ternary Content-Addressable Memory)**
- Modern Routers use CPUs to process control/management traffic, and ASIC/TCAM to process data traffic for maximum speed
