#### DAI
- *Dynamic ARP Inspection* is a security tool that inspects [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/ARP\|ARP]] packets in the network.
- Compares *ARP* messages against the [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/DHCP Snooping\|DHCP Snooping binding table]] to prevent [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/MITM-On-Path\|MITM/On-Path]] attacks
	- It is used to prevent [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Layer 2 Attack Types\|ARP Poisoning]]
- [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/DHCP Snooping\|DHCP Snooping]] is required for *DAI* to function
