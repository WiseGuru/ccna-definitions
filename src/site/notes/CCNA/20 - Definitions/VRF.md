#### VRF
- *Virtual Routing and Forwarding* allows a router to build *multiple routing tables*, effectively creating multiple virtual routers
	- It creates one *global* routing table, and a routing table for each *VRF*
	- Interfaces on *different* VRFs can't communicate with each other
- Frequently used with [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/MPLS\|MPLS]]
