#### Half-duplex
- Nodes on a *half-duplex* link are on the same [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Collision Domain\|Collision Domain]], and cannot send and receive data at the same time.
	- Notably, [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Hub\|hubs]] and [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Wireless Access Points\|Wireless APs]] function on *half-duplex* networks
