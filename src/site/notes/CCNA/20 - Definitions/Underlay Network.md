#### Underlay
- The *Underlay* is the underlying physical network which the [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Overlay Network\|Overlay Network]] is built on top of in an [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/SD-Access\|SD-Access]] network. 
	- When combined, they form the [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/Fabric\|Fabric]]

Any configuration can be used for the underlying physical network
			1. Links between devices can be [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 2\|Layer 2]] or [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 3\|Layer 3]] and any routing protocol can be used
		2. DNA center can be used to automatically provision the underlay network in new ('greenfield') sites
			1. In this case, [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 3\|Layer 3]] links are used between devices and [[CCNA/20 - Definitions/IS-IS\|IS-IS]] is used as the routing protocol
