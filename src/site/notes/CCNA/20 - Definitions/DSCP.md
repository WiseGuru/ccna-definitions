#### DSCP
*Differentiated Services Code Point* marking is the preferred method for classification and marking because the router can very quickly gather the information from a single byte in the IP header
	- It replaces the outdated IPv4 TOS field
- It is recommended to mark "scavenger" traffic (traffic from worms, P2P file sharing aps, etc.), with DSCP 8 (CS1)
