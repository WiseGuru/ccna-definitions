#### Stateless or Stateful
- Whether a service or protocol is stateless or stateful indicates whether it maintains a known "state" with its clients or other services
	- e.g., a stateless firewall only processes requests as they come, and does not actively track connections between hosts and servers
	- [[20 - Definitions/TCP\|TCP]] is a stateful protocol, because it keeps track of exchanges between hosts
	- [[20 - Definitions/UDP\|UDP]] is a stateless protocol, because no connection is established, and information is sent without confirming receipt
