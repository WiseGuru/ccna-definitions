#### Fiber
- *Fiber-optic Cables* use pulses of *infrared* or *visible* light (instead of electricity) to send signals through *optical fiber cabling*
	- Single-mode cables support higher bandwidth and transmits further, but is more expensive.
	- Multi-mode fiber is thicker, easier to work with, and offers more functionality, but has a shorter transmissible distance.
