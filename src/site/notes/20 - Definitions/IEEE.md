1. [[20 - Definitions/802.1X\|802.1X]]
	1.  [[20 - Definitions/IEEE\|IEEE]] standard that defines *Port-based Network Access Control (PNAC)* and is a data link layer authentication technology used to connect devices to a wired or wireless LAN
1. [[20 - Definitions/IEEE\|IEEE]] Open Standards:
	1.  [[20 - Definitions/STP\|802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)]]
		1.  The original Spanning Tree implementation
		1.  Uses one Spanning Tree for all [[20 - Definitions/VLAN\|VLANs]] in the LAN
	2.  [[20 - Definitions/Rapid STP\|802.1w Rapid STP (RSTP)]]
		1.  Significantly improved convergence time

	3.  802.1s Multiple [[20 - Definitions/STP\|Spanning Tree Protocol]] (MSTP)
		1.  Enables grouping and mapping [[20 - Definitions/VLAN\|VLANs]] into different spanning tree instances for load balancing
	4. [[20 - Definitions/dot1q\|802.1Q Trunking (dot1q trunking)]]
		1.  Enables traffic from multiple [[20 - Definitions/VLAN\|VLANs]] to be sent across individual [[20 - Definitions/Switch\|Switch]] interfaces
